We chose to analyze a dataset called Fatal Police Shootings, 2015-Present. We found this dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/washingtonpost/police-shootings. This dataset contains 2142 rows and 14 columns. Every row represents a fatal police shooting and the columns include the details about the shooting that are unique to every person. We were compelled by this dataset because fatal police shootings are shown in media to be a significant problem in the United States of America. By analyzing this dataset we can figure out what type of people get fatally shot the most and make an informed decision about media representations in this age of fake news. Our hypothesis states that more minorities are being killed by cops, particularly African American males.
